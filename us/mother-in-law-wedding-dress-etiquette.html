	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Some brides bring along just a couple of close friends while others are sure to have both their mom and future mother in law in tow. Per general etiquette the mother of the bride buys her wedding dayoutfit first then notifies the mother of the groom about the color length and overall formality of her choice. However the mother of the groom should attempt to dress in the same color palette and general style of the mother of the bride. <br>
